1) There is very little difference in the amount of the three cluster of both datasets. The first cluster of 1953 has 48 countries in it and 2008 has 46.
   The second cluster of 1953 has 60 countries in it and 2008 has 61. The third cluster of 1953 has 88 countries in it and 2008 has 89.
   The first cluster of the 1953 dataset is comprised of rich countries mostly located in North America and Europe.
   The second cluster of the 1953 dataset is comprised of middle income countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.
   The final cluster is comprised of poor Countries in Africa and Asia with a few Easter European countries making the list.
   In the 2008 dataset's first cluster comprises of mainly poor African countries and some Asian countries.
   The second cluster is made up of mostly Asian countries and the third cluster is copirsed of mostly European and American countries.
   The clusters differ greatly in terms of the countries that make up the cluster. They are almost opposite.
   The means differ greatly as well. This is because of the counties that correspond to the clusters.
   2008:
   Cluster 1 Mean Birthrate: 30.028 Mean life Expectancy: 47.199
   Cluster 2 Mean Birthrate: 23.34 Mean life Expectancy: 66.168
   Cluster 3 Mean Birthrate: 13.536 Mean life Expectancy: 79.014  
   1953:
   Cluster 1 Mean Birthrate: 21.227 Mean life Expectancy: 66.109
   Cluster 2 Mean Birthrate: 37.097 Mean life Expectancy: 59.743
   Cluster 3 Mean Birthrate: 48.332 Mean life Expectancy: 48.753

2) There are big geographical differences between countries in the first three clusters whereas the 4th cluster has pretty much the same countries in.
   There is only one 2008 country in the second cluster but there is a vast difference in the data from 1953 and 2008.
   Except for the third cluster the means correlate to the means of the datasets of 2008 and 1953.
   Cluster 1 Mean Birthrate: 21.227 Mean life Expectancy: 66.109
   Cluster 2 Mean Birthrate: 46.822 Mean life Expectancy: 42.28
   Cluster 3 Mean Birthrate: 15.917 Mean life Expectancy: 69.87
   Cluster 4 Mean Birthrate: 48.332 Mean life Expectancy: 48.753
